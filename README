Changelog:	
Version 2.1.1 (July 11th, 2012) 
* Fixed setValue() not checking if a max value was set for the stat. If there is one, the new value is clamped within that range. If not, the new value is unchanged.
* Added empty() and fill() function to the Stat class. Empty sets the stat value to 0 and calls the onEmpty function and fill sets the value to the max value (if there is one) and calls the onFull function.
